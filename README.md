# CS50web Project 0 - Search

* * *

This is my project 0 from [CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)

Basically we are required to replicate google's search page, it includes the main page, images and the start of advanced search.

[Official Requirements.](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/0/search/)

The pages should be able to submit a query to google and redirect to the result.

I also implemented some javascript to make a dynamic button that clears the input field, 
another js to replicate some effects for buttons and implemented a voice recognition search
using a the voice recognition api.
